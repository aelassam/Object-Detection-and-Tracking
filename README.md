# Object-Detection-and-Tracking


This project is a Python-based computer vision application that can detect and track objects in real-time using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. It uses pre-trained models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or SSD to detect objects, and implements algorithms like Kalman filtering or Optical Flow to track them.


## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the required packages and their dependencies.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

python src/main.py --model yolov3 --tracker kalman --video data/raw/example.mp4

This command will load the YOLOv3 model for object detection and the Kalman filter for object tracking, and apply them to the example video file in the data/raw directory.

You can also specify other models and trackers, as well as other input sources such as images or live camera streams. For more information on the available options, use the following command:

python src/main.py --help
